# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction and Analysis
# Overview
Hotel booking cancellations pose a significant challenge for the hospitality industry, directly impacting revenue management, operational planning, and resource allocation. By leveraging historical booking data and applying machine learning techniques, we can predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled before it happens. This enables hotels to make data-driven decisions, such as dynamic pricing, overbooking strategies, and better customer engagement, to minimize potential losses.
# Problem Statement
Cancellations account for a large portion of hotel bookings, creating uncertainty in demand forecasting and resulting in lost revenue, unutilized rooms, and disrupted planning. Traditional methods for handling cancellations (like fixed overbooking strategies) often fail to adapt to changing customer behavior.
The problem lies in accurately predicting whether a booking will be canceled based on customer and booking-related features such as lead time, previous cancellations, deposit type, and booking channel. The dataset contains a high number of features related to booking, such as lead time, deposit type, and special requests, which adds to the complexity of the model. The challenge lies in the data preprocessing steps, which include feature selection and engineering, handling missing values, and noise in the data. Additionally, we are going to train different models, evaluate their performance using the right metrics.
# Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a hotel booking will be canceled. Specifically, this project aims to:

Preprocess and analyze hotel booking data, handling missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.

Build and evaluate machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to classify bookings as canceled or not canceled.

Compare models using performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Provide insights to hotels for better revenue management, including minimizing lost revenue and improving operational efficiency.
